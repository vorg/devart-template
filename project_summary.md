## Description
We treat the web as a source, a place we get things from. With a single click the collective power of the servers in the cloud delivers an answer to any question. We accept it and move forward. But what have had just happend? 

I want the remove layers of abstraction covering a simple web page request. We leave traces, we constantly leave little bits of information, here and there, IP, ping, cookie, geolocation... 

For the web nowadays, we are the data.

```
#one page, many different types of data
@mimeTypes = unique(@entries.map(getEntryMimeType)) 

#one page, many different servers
@servers = unique(@entries.map(getEntryUrl).map(urlToHostName))

#one page, many different organizations
@rootServers = unique(@servers.map(extractTopLevelDomain))
```
